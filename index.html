Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The goal of the code is to create an HTML drawing canvas that has four buttons below the canvas.
The first button draws a rectangle on the canvas when pressed. 
The second button writes the name "Philip Nguyen" when pressed. 
The third button loads an image of a dog when pressed. 
THe fourth button clears the canvas when pressed. 


Known Issues:
There are no known issues with this program. However, I would like to explore other ways to have the image pop up on the canvas.
